## Description
This repository combined every R scripts developed for the analyse of 
acute hypotensive episodes in intensive care unit. 
The data used for this study were the multiparameter intelligent monitoring in intensive care II (MIMIC-II). This is a large, single-center database comprising information relating to patients admitted to critical care units at a large tertiary care hospital. This study was designed to provide physiologic waveform and numeric series such as MAP, heart rate, spO2 to explore in ICU patients. Data were collected between 2001 and 2008 from a variety of ICUs (medical, surgical, coronary care, and neonatal) in a single tertiary teaching hospital.
